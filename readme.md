# String Theory

String Theory aims to be an open-source tool that helps amateur musicians perform and compose pieces of music.


Its goal is to make more accessible and easy to understand some parts of musical theory that may be confusing or hard to remember.

## So how does it work?

It's divided into two parts: an API and a client application.
The client application can be whatever: I've included an example [here](https://github.com/skycleaver/string_theory_frontend).
Its role is to perform the calls to the API and format the information for the user.


The API offers a series of endpoints to elements of the domain: chords, scales... Let's see an example.
